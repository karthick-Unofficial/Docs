orion-components:
- Worked on implementing different approaches to add truncation in Text cards and some of those are as follows:

- Worked on sorting out the causes of "items" and "profileIconTemplate" props auto-updation issues in camerasMapLayerContainer.

profileIconTemplate:
- Noticed profileIconTemplate updating eventhough the values are'nt changed.
- Replaced profileIconTemplate as variable inside camerasMapLayer instead of having it as prop solves this issue.

items:
- This behaviour of items prop seems to originate from Map/Selector.
- entityType property of items prop has been constanly updating during lodash's merge in cameraProps/accessPointProps in Map/Selector.
- Adding entityType as a child of "entityData.properties" by default solves this issue.

- Worked on testing flickering scenarios in cameras-app workflow.
